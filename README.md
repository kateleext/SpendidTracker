# 打卡: Turning Expense Tracking into Visual Stories

## The Spark

I still remember that evening clearly. My mom sat at our dining table, staring at her phone with a furrowed brow. Another text from Susan, our domestic helper who has cared for my grandfather for the past decade, asking for additional money beyond the monthly stipend. "Where is all the money going?" Mom whispered, more to herself than to me. 

Since my grandmother passed away two years ago, my mom has taken over managing Grandpa's care, but the financial picture has become increasingly murky. The monthly HK$2,500 allocated for groceries and daily necessities seems to disappear with little evidence of where it's spent. Mom would scroll through sparse WhatsApp messages showing occasional photos of Grandpa eating, but nothing connected these moments to the expenses.

## Personal Journey

For my mom, the situation was emotionally draining. Having never worked in an office environment, she lacked management experience and found it difficult to request financial accountability without seeming distrustful. She didn't want to risk creating tension that might affect Grandpa's care quality. 

"All I could do was vent to you and other family members," she told me later. "I felt so helpless and frustrated."

I realized that my mom wasn't concerned about tracking every dollar and cent. She just wanted peace of mind that the money was actually improving Grandpa's quality of life. The emotional reassurance was more important than precision accounting.

What complicated matters further was Susan's background. Like many domestic helpers in Hong Kong, she had started working in households when she was barely an adult. She had never seen a spreadsheet in her life, let alone understood what "expense tracking" meant. Her technological world consisted solely of an old smartphone where she spent her limited free time on social media and YouTube. The idea of implementing any traditional financial tracking system was clearly impractical for both parties.

## Quick Context

In Hong Kong, domestic helpers are woven into the fabric of family life. With approximately 5% of the population—around 400,000 people—working as foreign domestic helpers, they're not just for wealthy families. Due to our high living costs, small home sizes, and the need for dual incomes, many Hong Kong families like ours rely on domestic helpers to care for children and elderly family members.

These helpers, predominantly women from the Philippines and Indonesia, live in our homes, sometimes in challenging conditions with minimal privacy. By law, they must reside with their employers, creating a unique 24/7 working relationship that can blur professional boundaries. While the arrangement provides essential care for families, it can also create management challenges, particularly around financial transparency—something my mom experienced firsthand.

## Gong Siu (講笑)

When I was brainstorming names for the app, I landed on "打卡" (da3 ka1), which perfectly captures its dual purpose through clever Cantonese wordplay:

Among my friends, "打卡" is commonly used to describe taking photos and sharing them on social media—particularly for Instagram Stories or check-ins. When we visit a trendy café or scenic spot, we'll say we're going to "打卡" (take a picture to share online).

But "打卡" traditionally means "to punch a card" or "clock in" at work, referencing the old time-card systems used to track working hours. This connects to the app's tracking and recording functionality.

Together, these meanings blend seamlessly to represent what I wanted to create—an app that transforms financial record-keeping into a visual storytelling experience. Making expense tracking as natural as sharing a social media story while maintaining the systematic nature of financial recording.

## Fresh Perspective

My "aha moment" came when I stopped thinking about expense tracking like an accountant and started thinking about it like a daughter watching her mom worry. Traditional expense trackers focus on precision and categorization—capturing every dollar in its proper account. But in our family caregiving situation, what mattered more was trust and emotional connection.

By shifting from a ledger-focused approach to a story-focused one, I could address the real underlying need: confirmation that money spent translates to care received. The visual evidence creates an emotional bridge between financial outlay and quality of life, something spreadsheets could never achieve.

The solution had to work within Susan's technological comfort zone—social media. If she could post stories on Instagram and send photos on WhatsApp, she could use an app that followed those same familiar patterns. No spreadsheets, no categories, no financial jargon—just photos and simple numbers.
